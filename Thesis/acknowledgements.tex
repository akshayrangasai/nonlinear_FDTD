I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Krishnan Balasubramanian and Dr. L Vijayaraghavan for giving me the opportunity to work on such a multi-disciplinary project. Their guidance, advice and efforts have been instrumental in
accelerating the achievements of this project. I wish to thank them for granting me the freedom to work on the topic of my interest and at my own pace.
\\ \\ \\
I would also like to thank Dr. Sivaramanivas Ramaswamy of GE, JHWTC for introducing me to NDT and also to finite difference simulations. His guidance proved to be the launching pad I could used to complete this project.
\\ \\ \\
Finally, the project would not have reached the current stage if not for the moral support and guidance of my friends and family. Their constant encouragement served as motivation throughout the project.
\\ \\ \\ \\
With warm regards, \\
D Akshay Rangasai
